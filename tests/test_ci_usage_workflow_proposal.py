"""The venice-review usage-artifact rollout is a patch this repo hands to 18
repos by hand. Nothing executes it here, so these tests are the only thing that
can catch a proposal that has rotted: a placeholder left in the pin, a `.patch`
and a `.proposed` that no longer agree, or an edit that quietly went missing.

The three edits, per workflow:
  1. `VENICE_USAGE_DB` on the review step's env (the ledger must leave $HOME)
  2. an `if: always()` export step (the ledger must become a file)
  3. an `if: always()` upload step (the file must leave the runner)
plus the council pin bump, without which step 2 has no command to run.
