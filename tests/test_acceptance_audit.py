"""Acceptance criteria from docs/council-audit-2026-06-25.md, replayed against the
real PR #9 / #11 scenarios. The FakeClient scripts each seat as it actually answered;
the chair's `blocking_findings` is its grounded verdict given the file_context the shim
now supplies. These assert the gate's CONTRACT: false positives stop blocking, true
positives still gate."""
