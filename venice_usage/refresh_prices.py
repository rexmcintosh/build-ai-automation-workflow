"""Regenerate `venice_usage/price_table.py` from Venice's live catalogue.

One command, so the next refresh is not a research session:

    python -m venice_usage.refresh_prices            # show the diff, write nothing
    python -m venice_usage.refresh_prices --write    # rewrite price_table.py
    python -m venice_usage.refresh_prices --check    # exit 2 if the table is stale

**Never type a price from memory, and never trust an old bill.** The seed table
this replaced had `claude-opus-4-8` at 15.00/75.00 when Venice bills 6.00/30.00,
and `deepseek-v4-pro` at 0.50/2.00 when Venice bills 1.65/3.301 — wrong by 2.5x
in one direction and 3.3x in the other, on the same four-row table. Seventeen
further models in the ledger had no row at all and were valued at zero.

Where each figure comes from
----------------------------

* **input, output, cache_read** — `GET /api/v1/models`, `model_spec.pricing`
  (`input`, `output`, `cache_input`). The catalogue is the *current* price list;
  a bill is a historical fact that may already have been superseded. Venice
  reprices without notice: `openai-gpt-56-sol` billed 6.25/37.50 on 2026-09-03
  and 2.50/12.50 on 2026-09-10. So the catalogue wins for these three fields and
  a disagreeing bill is reported, not applied.

* **which cache-write SKUs a model actually has** — `GET /billing/usage-history`
  (admin key), never the model's name or vendor. Venice segments cache writes by
  TTL for some models and not others, and only the billed SKU string says which:

      claude-sonnet-5-api-llm-cache-write-5m-mtoken   3.7500  = 1.25x input
      claude-sonnet-5-api-llm-cache-write-1h-mtoken   6.0000  = 2.00x input
      openai-gpt-56-sol-llm-cache-write-mtoken        3.1250  = 1.25x input

  A model billed a TTL-suffixed SKU gets `cache_write_5m` / `cache_write_1h` and
  **only for the TTLs that were actually billed** — no 1-hour rate is derived
  from a multiplier for a model that has never been billed one. A model billed
  one un-suffixed SKU gets a single `cache_write`. A model never billed a cache
  write at all falls back to the catalogue's `cache_write` under the un-suffixed
  key, which claims no TTL segmentation. Where the catalogue publishes no cache
  rate, none is invented and no key is emitted.

* **the rate itself** — `amount / units` per SKU, cross-checked against the
  `pricePerUnitUsd` the same rows carry. They agree to within float noise
  (`0.612379` units for `0.168410` DIEM derives 0.2750034, and the published
  number is 0.275), so the published number is used whenever the two agree to
  0.1% and the derived one otherwise. Where a SKU was repriced inside the
  window, the **latest** rate is the live one and the move is recorded.

One figure that looks wrong and is not: `claude-fable-5-1` reads cache at 0.30
against a 12.00 input (0.025x) while `claude-fable-5`, on the same 12.00 input,
reads at 1.20 (0.1x). The catalogue says so and the bills agree. Do not
"correct" it.

Nothing here writes to the usage ledger. The ledger is opened read-only, purely
to ask which model ids have to be covered.

`PRICES` is DIEM (== USD on this account) per 1,000,000 tokens. Cache keys are
deliberately uneven and that is the point:

* `cache_write_5m` / `cache_write_1h` — the model is billed TTL-segmented
  cache-write SKUs, and only the TTLs actually seen on a bill are listed. No
  1-hour rate is derived from a multiplier.
* `cache_write` — one un-suffixed rate: either the bills show a single SKU with
  no TTL in its name, or the catalogue publishes a write rate this account has
  never been billed, in which case no TTL segmentation is claimed.
* no `cache_write*` key at all — the catalogue publishes no write rate and none
  was invented.
* `cache_read` likewise varies inside a family: claude-fable-5 reads at 1.20 and
  claude-fable-5-1 at 0.30 on the same 12.00 input. Billed fact, not a typo.

`EXTENDED` records above-threshold context tiers verbatim; `estimate_usd` does
not apply them (no ledger row has ever crossed a threshold, so there is no
billed line item confirming what the threshold counts). `BILLED` is the receipts
the cache shapes above were taken from.
