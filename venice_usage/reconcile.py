"""Check a ledger rollup against what Venice actually billed.

    python -m venice_usage.reconcile --since 2026-09-04 --project council

This is the feedback loop whose absence let a 2.5x pricing error reach an audit.
The ledger's `usd` is an estimate; `GET /billing/usage-history` is the invoice.
Nothing else on this box compares the two per model, so nothing else could have
noticed that `claude-opus-4-8` was being valued at 15.00/75.00 against a 6.00 /
30.00 bill while grok, codex and gemini were being counted as free.

How the two sides are joined. The bills carry no project tag, so an account-wide
window cannot be compared to one project's rollup directly. Every billed line
item does carry `inferenceDetails.requestId`, `promptTokens` and
`completionTokens`, and the ledger records the same two token counts and a
second-precision timestamp for each call. So the billed rows are folded into
requests, and each ledger row is matched to the unclaimed request with the same
(model, prompt tokens, completion tokens) nearest it in time. A request is
claimed once. Rows that match nothing are reported, not quietly dropped —
usually the last call of the window, whose bill has not landed yet.

Billed model ids sometimes carry a serving suffix the ledger does not
(`deepseek-v4-pro-api`), which `refresh_prices.resolve_id` already handles.

Backfill: the other side of the join
------------------------------------

Drift is the small problem. The large one is a billed request with *no* ledger
row at all. Usage is recorded client-side, after a response lands, so a session
killed mid-call leaves the spend with no local trace whatsoever — and this host
OOM-kills sessions about seventeen times a month. Two confirmed instances: a
hand-written recovery note for a `claude-fable-5-1` call ("orchestration client
killed before saving response", 2.7549 DIEM), and `claude-fable-5-1` as a
whole — 38.52 DIEM of output over three weeks, the account's dearest model,
appearing in no ledger row at any point.

`--backfill` reconstructs those rows from the invoice. Every reconstructed row
is marked three ways so it can never be mistaken for one the client wrote:

* `ext_id = "venice-bill:<requestId>"` — the row's identity AND its provenance.
  The ledger already carries a UNIQUE partial index on `ext_id`, so this is
  also what makes the operation idempotent for free; `ext_id LIKE
  'venice-bill:%'` is exactly the reconstructed set, the same way `gh:%` is
  exactly the CI set (see `portable.py`). A row the client wrote has
  `ext_id IS NULL`, always.
* `source = "reconcile/billing"` — `source` is already a `report --group-by`
  column, so recovered spend is visible in the ordinary rollup with no schema
  change and no new query to remember.
* `project = "unattributed"` — `/billing/usage-history` carries no key or
  project tag (verified: the line items hold only sku, amount, timestamp and
  `inferenceDetails`). Guessing a project would be inventing data inside the
  audit trail. `--backfill-project` exists for when the operator actually
  knows.

The `usd` column gets the **billed** amount, not a token estimate: the invoice
is the fact, and it includes the cache-write premium Venice injects, which no
estimate from token counts can see. Read those rows with
`report --price-basis stored`.

Idempotency has two independent layers. The UNIQUE `ext_id` index makes a
second write a no-op, and on the next pass the row written by the first pass
matches its own bill, so the request is no longer an orphan at all. Re-running
over an overlapping window is therefore free — which is what lets the cron job
use a window several times wider than its period and still catch bills that
land late.

Reads only, unless `--backfill` is passed. The read path opens the ledger
read-only and Venice is only ever asked for usage history — no chat completion
is made on any path.
