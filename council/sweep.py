"""`council sweep` — autonomous, repo-wide security research.

Beyond the diff-only PR review: walk the whole tree, fan the security panel across
it chunk by chunk, aggregate + dedup the findings, gate by confidence, and let the
chair write a phone-glanceable summary. Explicitly *bounded* (max_chunks) and it
*reports what it drops* — never a silent cap. It reports; it opens nothing.
