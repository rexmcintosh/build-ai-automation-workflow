"""Merge-gate decision: which panel findings actually block a PR.

The v0.2.0 gate was a single-lens OR over raw panelist findings — any one seat's
`critical`/`high`-c>=8 failed the PR, the chair had no say, and nothing was
verified against the code (audit F1/F2/F4/F6). This module replaces that with:

  1. severity normalization        — "High"/"blocker" no longer slip the gate (F6)
  2. blast-radius tier             — dev tooling gates only on confident criticals (F6)
  3. tier-aware candidate bar      — the panel must find something serious enough
  4. chair-arbitrated grounding    — only findings the chair confirms (given full
                                     file context) count; it can drop false
                                     positives but cannot manufacture a block (F1/F2/F4)
