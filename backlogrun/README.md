# backlog-run

The 3am backlog runner and the morning-review tool for `~/projects/backlog`.
Spec: `../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-03-backlog-runner-design.md`.
Contract it obeys: `~/projects/backlog/README.md` § "Safety contract for the 3am runner".

Each `open` item is worked by a cold, headless Claude Code session inside its own git
worktree on a fresh `claude/bl-<slug>` branch of the item's repo, council-reviewed, and left
as `in_review` (or `held`) for you. Nothing is ever pushed or merged by the clock.

## Commands

    backlog-run work --dry-run           # what tonight would do; changes nothing
    backlog-run work                     # the nightly run (cron); open -> in_review | held
    backlog-run work --only <id>         # one specific item (also --repo NAME, --max-items N)
    backlog-run report                   # morning report, numbered
    backlog-run show 1  |  diff 1        # details / full diff (number from the report, or an id)
    backlog-run approve 1 3              # merge --no-ff into main, push, delete branch, archive done
    backlog-run approve <id> --held      # same for a held item's branch (read its note first)
    backlog-run drop 2                   # delete branch (journaled), archive dropped
    backlog-run hold <id> "why"          # park an item;  backlog-run reopen <id> returns it
    backlog-run list

`work` flags: `--max-items` (2) · `--item-timeout` seconds (3600) · `--deadline` seconds
(10800) · `--budget-usd` per session (20; 0 = none) · `--model` · `--no-council` ·
`--no-notify` · `--keep-worktree`.

## What the session gets

- cwd = the worktree; prompt = runner contract + the item's `prompt`; the repo's own
  CLAUDE.md applies.
- A whitelist environment (no `~/.env`, no Claude-session vars); `git push` to any
  https/ssh/git remote rewritten to a dead path via `GIT_CONFIG_*` `pushInsteadOf` (local-path
  remotes, i.e. temp repos in test suites, still work); deny rules for push/deploy/send/spend
  commands (held in `~/projects/.backlog-run/claude-settings.json`); no MCP servers.
- It must end with a `RUNNER-OUTCOME: done|held|failed` block; `held` is its escape hatch
  for anything that needs a human or an outward action.

## Guarantees under failure

- An item is only transitioned if it is **still `open`** when the run finishes. If you
  held/reopened it meanwhile, your state wins and the run's result becomes a
  `runner: CONFLICT …` note (the branch is kept).
- An empty leftover `claude/bl-*` branch (no commits, no worktree) is reclaimed on the next
  run, journaled; a leftover branch **with** work holds the item instead.
- Every branch that carries work is council-reviewed — held ones too. A council failure is
  recorded as the verdict (`REVIEW FAILED: …`); the item still goes to `in_review` — the
  morning report shows it, you review by hand.
- `approve` takes `in_review` items; a held item's branch needs `--held`.
- `repo:` must resolve inside `~/projects` (no `..`, no absolute escapes) or the item is held.
- `approve` records the merge in the backlog **before** deleting the branch and is safe to
  re-run (an already-merged branch is not merged twice). `drop` records before deleting.
- An archive move writes `archive.yaml` first; an id found in both files is reconciled in
  favour of the archive on the next write.
- Lock contention exits 75 (`EX_TEMPFAIL`), so a skipped nightly run shows up in `cron.log`.

## Item fields the runner writes

`status`, `branch`, `worked`, `council`, `note`, `session` (claude session id), `cost_usd`.
`approve` adds `merged`, `merge_commit`; `drop` adds `dropped`. Both move the item to
`archive.yaml`.

## State

`~/projects/.backlog-run/`: `report.md` + `report.json` (number → id), `reviews/<id>.md`
(full council output), `runs/<ts>-<id>.json` (raw session result), `journal.log`
(branch deletions: ts, repo, branch, sha, action — restore with `git branch <name> <sha>`),
`lock`, `cron.log`.

Environment overrides: `BACKLOG_PATH`, `BACKLOG_RUN_STATE`, `BACKLOG_RUN_PROJECTS`,
`BACKLOG_RUN_CLAUDE` (binary), `BACKLOG_RUN_GIT=0` (no backlog commits),
`BACKLOG_RUN_TG=0` (no Telegram), `BACKLOG_RUN_TG_CHAT`, `BACKLOG_RUN_TG_SEND`,
`BACKLOG_RUN_ENV_FILE` (where the Venice key is read from for the council step).

## Cron

    0 3 * * *  /home/dev/.local/bin/backlog-run work >> /home/dev/projects/.backlog-run/cron.log 2>&1

## Install / update

    pipx install --force ~/projects/build-ai-automation-workflow

## Tests

    python3 -m pytest tests/test_backlogrun.py -q

They run the whole `work`/`approve`/`drop` flow against temp git repos with a fake `claude`
binary (no network, no real sessions) and assert the scrubbed environment, the pushurl
guard, the state transitions, the YAML round trip and the lock.

## Review readiness

`in_review` means the work awaits your decision. It does not mean checks passed.
The report now shows one of four evidence states for each worked branch:

| State | Meaning | Suggested next step |
|---|---|---|
| Ready for your review | Explicit completed outcome, explicit clean council verdict, and the declared checks passed for the current branch commit. | Read the full evidence, then decide. |
| Changes requested | The council names unresolved fixes or conditions. | Address the listed conditions. |
| Review or checks failed | The runner, reviewer, synthesis, or a required check failed. | Inspect the failure evidence. |
| Review readiness unknown | Evidence is missing, malformed, incomplete, contradictory, or covers another commit. | Inspect or refresh the evidence. |

The outcome marker must occupy its own line; merely mentioning it in prose cannot
establish completion. Markdown decoration around the marker is supported.
The report preserves full conditions and links to the full review. Its JSON adds
`review_readiness`, keyed by item ID; the existing `numbers` mapping stays intact.
`show` displays the same readiness and full evidence. Short notifications state
readiness and point to `show`, instead of clipping a possibly conditional verdict.
Only ready rows suggest the numbered `approve` command. This is display guidance:
`approve` keeps its existing human authority and behavior, including `--held`.
There is no new approval gate and no automatic merge.

For new items, an optional `required_validations` list declares check names before
the session starts, for example `required_validations: [pytest, lint]`. Names are
labels, not commands that the parent runner executes. The session follows the
repo's instructions to run them and returns a one-line `RUNNER-VALIDATIONS` JSON
array with `name`, `branch_sha`, `status` (`passed`, `failed`, or `unknown`), and
`evidence` (command, exit code, and output, as a string or JSON object). The runner saves that evidence and
includes it in the council's input. Results are explicitly **session-reported**;
the parent does not independently rerun the commands. All reported checks must
refer to the reviewed commit. Missing or malformed results cannot imply success.

An absent required list means validation coverage is unknown, even if the review
is clean. An explicit empty list is appropriate only for work with no required
commands. Neither the session nor this upgrade fills in or relaxes that list.
Existing backlog records are not rewritten. A historical prose verdict, including
one that says "approve", stays unknown with its old full review still accessible.

Each new attempt creates `runs/<timestamp>-<id>.json` before starting the session,
then fills in the raw result. Evidence lives under `reviews/` with the same stem:
`.md` (complete review and conditions), `.validation-N.txt` (reported check output),
`.inputs.json` (version 1 inputs), and `.readiness.json` (derived snapshot). The
legacy `reviews/<id>.md` path remains the latest full review. Prior attempt files
remain intact. Reports recompute from the inputs and the current branch commit;
they never trust a cached ready snapshot. An unfinished or malformed newest
attempt cannot reuse a clean older review.

The evidence validator checks types, readable files inside the state directory,
UTC timestamps, commit identity, and contradictory outcomes. A later complete
review supersedes older evidence for the same commit. Conflicting duplicate IDs
or conflicting newest records remain unknown. A truncated review input or an
incomplete panel also remains unknown; reviewer or synthesis errors are failures.

Run the focused checks with:

    python3 -m pytest tests/test_backlogrun.py tests/test_backlog_readiness.py tests/test_synthesize.py -q
