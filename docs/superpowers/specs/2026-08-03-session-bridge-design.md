# Session Bridge — per-tmux-session Telegram conversations

**Date:** 2026-08-03
**Status:** Approved design, pending implementation
**Location:** `~/projects/build-ai-automation-workflow/session-bridge/`

## Goal

Let Rex hold a conversation with any specific Claude Code tmux session from his phone.
The organizing unit is the tmux session: one Telegram forum topic ("tab") per tmux
session, named after it, inside a single private group. No generic always-listening
assistant session.

Decisions locked during brainstorm:

1. **Coverage:** all tmux sessions, automatically. No opt-in flag.
2. **Mirroring:** tabs are quiet by default. Only replies to phone-originated messages
   land in a tab. Terminal work never mirrors.
3. **Approvals:** permission prompts can be approved/denied from the tab, with an
   explicit confirm word.

## Non-goals

- Replacing the existing main bot. Bebop briefings and `agents` nudges continue on the
  current bot, untouched.
- Message history/search (Telegram Bot API has none).
- Rich media inbound (photos etc.) — v1 is text only in both directions.
- Moving `agents` nudges into tabs (possible future; nudges stay in the main-bot DM).

## Components

### 1. Bot: Wall-E (@WallFred_bot)

- Dedicated bot; token at `~/.config/session-bridge/.env` (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=`, mode 600).
- Needed because a Telegram bot token allows exactly one long-poll consumer, and the
  main bot's slot is contested by the telegram channel plugin that Claude sessions spawn.
- The bot must be **admin** of the group (grants Manage Topics *and* bypasses privacy
  mode so it sees all group messages; `getMe` currently shows
  `can_read_all_group_messages: false`, which admin status overrides).

### 2. Group: "Claude Sessions"

- Private supergroup with **Topics enabled**. One forum topic per tmux session, named
  exactly like the session (e.g. `loom-14`).
- Group ID is pinned in config once at setup. The bridge hard-ignores every other chat.

### 3. Bridge daemon (`session-bridge`)

A single Bun script run as a systemd **user** service (`session-bridge.service`,
`Restart=always`). It is a dumb postman: no LLM, no policy decisions beyond this spec.

Responsibilities:

- **Long-poll** `getUpdates` with a persisted offset (nothing lost across restarts —
  Telegram queues messages while the daemon is down).
- **Topic sync** (every 30 s and on every update batch):
  - `tmux ls` → session list, minus exclude patterns (default: `^cai/`, `^codex-`).
  - New session → `createForumTopic` named after it; record `session ↔ topic_id` in
    state. Session gone → rename topic to `✖ <name>` + `closeForumTopic` (archived,
    reversible, never deleted).
  - Names are unique by construction (harness suffixes `-N`), so the map is 1:1. If a
    name ever repeats after its topic was closed, create a fresh topic.
- **Inbound routing** — for each message: accept only if `chat.id` = configured group,
  `from.id` = 7735693897, and `message_thread_id` maps to a live session. Everything
  else is dropped silently (no pairing replies, no error chatter to strangers).
- **State classification** before injecting, reusing the `agents` script's pane
  heuristics (BLOCKED / WORKING / WAITING / IDLE via `tmux capture-pane`).

Inbound behavior by state:

| Session state | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| WAITING / IDLE | Inject the text (below), reply "→ delivered". Set the reply flag. |
| WORKING | Inject (Claude Code queues typed input mid-turn), reply "session is working — queued; the next answer may belong to its current task". Set the reply flag. |
| BLOCKED | Do **not** inject. Send the pane's prompt excerpt (last ~15 lines) and enter approval mode for this topic. |
| GONE | Reply "session ended", close the topic. |

Approval mode (per topic, while the session stays BLOCKED):

- `approve` → `tmux send-keys '1'` (selects the modal's "Yes").
- `deny` → `tmux send-keys Escape` (cancels, returns control to Claude).
- A bare number `1`–`9` → presses that option (covers multi-option modals like
  AskUserQuestion).
- Anything else → re-send the prompt excerpt with "say approve, deny, or an option
  number". After any keypress, capture the pane again and confirm the new state in the
  tab. If the session is no longer BLOCKED on re-check, fall through to normal handling.

Text injection mechanics:

- `tmux set-buffer` + `paste-buffer -p -t <session>` (bracketed paste, so multi-line
  messages don't submit early), then `send-keys Enter`.
- Text is passed literally — never through a shell, no interpolation.

Reply flag: `~/.local/state/session-bridge/pending/<session>` containing
`{topic_id, ts}`. Written on every successful injection; consumed by the Stop hook.

### 4. Reply hook (Stop hook, global)

Registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` → `hooks.Stop`. A small script that:

1. Exits instantly (cost ≈ 0) if `$TMUX` is unset or no reply flag exists for
   `tmux display-message -p '#S'`.
2. Otherwise: reads the hook's stdin JSON (`transcript_path`), extracts the last
   assistant message's text blocks from the transcript JSONL, POSTs to the flagged
   `topic_id` via `sendMessage`, and deletes the flag.
3. Sends **plain text** (no `parse_mode` — avoids MarkdownV2 escaping failures), split
   into ≤4096-char chunks on paragraph boundaries.
4. On send failure: log to stderr and leave the flag in place so the next Stop
   retries; a flag older than 1 h is stale and gets deleted instead of retried.

## Data & config layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.config/session-bridge/.env` | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (600) — DONE at design time |
| `~/.config/session-bridge/config.json` | `groupId`, `allowedUserId` (7735693897), `excludePatterns`, poll/sync intervals |
| `~/.local/state/session-bridge/state.json` | update offset, `session ↔ topic_id` map, topic status |
| `~/.local/state/session-bridge/pending/<session>` | reply flag: `{topic_id, ts}` |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/session-bridge.service` | unit file |

## Security model

- Exactly one allowed user ID, one allowed group ID; all else dropped with no response.
- Token file mode 600; token never appears in logs or process args (read from env file).
- Inbound text is injected via tmux buffers only — no shell evaluation anywhere.
- The bridge can only do what a person at the keyboard could do in tmux; it adds no new
  capability surface beyond remote keyboard access for one user.
- House rule respected: topic close/rename fires on observed session disappearance
  (edge-triggered from polling, reversible, non-destructive). No destructive mutation
  ever keys off fuzzy session-end events.

## Failure modes

- **Daemon down:** messages queue server-side at Telegram; offset resume on restart.
  systemd restarts on crash.
- **Hook fails:** one missed tab reply; retried on next Stop via surviving flag; session
  unaffected; `agents` nudges unaffected.
- **Queued-message quirk (known, accepted):** messaging a WORKING session means the
  next Stop may answer its in-flight task, not you; your answer follows on the Stop
  after. The bridge warns in-tab whenever it queues.
- **Modal drift:** if Claude Code's modal strings change, BLOCKED detection degrades to
  WAITING/IDLE and the bridge would paste text at a frozen prompt (expected to be
  benign, but verified during live smoke testing). Heuristics live in one function
  shared conceptually with `agents`; update both together.

## Setup checklist (user steps)

1. ~~Create bot via BotFather~~ — DONE (@WallFred_bot).
2. Create private group "Claude Sessions"; enable Topics in group settings.
3. Add @WallFred_bot as **admin** with Manage Topics.
4. Send any message in the group; the implementer pins the group ID into `config.json`.
5. Approve the two gated installs (auto-mode blocks agent writes here — each is handed
   to Rex as a `!` one-liner if prompted): the Stop-hook entry in
   `~/.claude/settings.json`, and `systemctl --user enable --now session-bridge`.

## Testing

- Unit-ish: classification + transcript-extraction functions get fixture tests (pane
  dumps, sample JSONL) run via `bun test`.
- Live smoke, in order: topic auto-created for a scratch tmux session → inbound text
  appears in its Claude prompt → reply lands in the right tab → WORKING queue warning →
  BLOCKED excerpt + approve presses "Yes" → session kill → topic archived with ✖.

## Future (explicitly deferred)

- Nudges (`agents`) posting into tabs instead of the main-bot DM.
- Inbound photo forwarding to the session.
- Starting a *new* session from Telegram ("open a tab for project X").
