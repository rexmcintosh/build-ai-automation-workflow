# Recover Venice spend the ledger never saw.
#
# Usage is written client-side, AFTER a response lands. A session killed mid-call
# leaves the bill with no local trace at all, and this host OOM-kills sessions
# about seventeen times a month (see the vps-oom-sessions note). Two confirmed
# holes: a hand-written recovery note for one 2.7549-DIEM claude-fable-5-1 call,
# and claude-fable-5-1 as a whole — 38.52 DIEM of output over three weeks, the
# account's dearest model, in no ledger row at all.
#
# This asks /billing/usage-history for the last N days, finds every billed
# request no ledger row claims, and appends one row per request:
#
#     project    = unattributed        (the invoice carries no project tag)
#     task_type  = recovered
#     source     = reconcile/billing
#     ext_id     = venice-bill:<requestId>
#     usd        = the billed DIEM, not a token estimate
#
# Idempotent twice over: ext_id is UNIQUE in the ledger, and on the next run the
# row this one wrote matches its own bill, so the request is no longer an orphan.
# Re-running over an overlapping window is free — which is exactly why the window
# is wider than the schedule period: a bill that lands late is still caught.
