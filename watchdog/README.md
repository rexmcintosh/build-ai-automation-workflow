# watchdog — autonomous SRE for the mesh

Watches the automation system's *own* moving parts (bebop, loom, MeetTrack, disk,
key services). When a signal is anomalous, a read-only agent investigates and posts
a **diagnosis + proposed fix** to Telegram. It never fixes production — it puts a fix
on a silver platter and lets Rex decide. (Maps to the "autonomous SRE" idea from
Naval's *AI Industrial Revolution* — minus the auto-remediation, by design.)

## Cheap-first

A pure-Python pre-check (`watchdog/run.py`) collects signals and triages them with
**flap suppression** — no tokens are spent on a healthy poll. Only when something
*fires* does the shell invoke the investigator agent.

## Run

```bash
./watchdog/run-watchdog.sh --dry-run   # collect + triage, print what WOULD escalate
./watchdog/run-watchdog.sh             # …and actually investigate + notify on escalation
```

## What it checks (v1)

| Check | Signal | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `bebop` | `bebop/logs/runs.log` | last run failed (crit), or no run in >14h (warn) |
| `disk` | `df -P /` | ≥95% crit, ≥85% warn |
| `svc:tailscaled` | `systemctl is-active` | not `active` (crit) |
| `cron:*` | loom + MeetTrack logs | error markers in the recent tail (warn) |

Error-marker matching ignores `key=value` counters (e.g. `failed=0`) so metric lines
don't read as failures.

## Spike monitoring (rate/volume, not just failures)

The failure checks above answer *"did something error?"*. The spike monitor answers
*"is something doing far more than normal?"* — the gap that let a weekend splash_poller
restart-storm burn through Supabase writes while every poll still read "all ok".
Config lives in [`monitors.toml`](monitors.toml) (data, not code; no secrets):

| Layer | Watches | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — log counters** | `relaunched`/`launched` (supervise), `ingested` (ingest), summed over the recent window | value ≥ budget |
| **1 — processes** | live `poller.py` count (`ps`) | count ≥ budget |
| **2 — Supabase** | row counts of hot tables (`results`,`splits`,`swimmers`) via read-only PostgREST | rows/hour ≥ budget |

Detection uses **hard budgets** (no cold-start, no tuning). Every metric value is logged
on **every poll** (`metrics:` lines in `logs/runs.log`) so you can calibrate the budgets
and add statistical thresholds later. Supabase needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the
environment — the runner sources it from `WATCHDOG_ENV_FILE` (default
`/home/dev/projects/splash_poller/.env`) **inside a subshell**, so the investigator agent
never inherits the secret.

### Layer 3 — Supabase spend cap (manual, do once)

The watchdog is the in-system tripwire; the provider-side cap is the seatbelt that stops
spend even if the VPS is down. In the Supabase dashboard for project
**`moaagxigxjyuuqygoqfg`**: *Organization → Billing → Cost Control* — set a **spend cap**,
and *Project → Settings → Billing* — add a **usage alert** email. This isn't code; it's a
two-minute config that backstops everything above.

## Flap suppression

`triage()` re-alerts a problem only when it's **new**, has **worsened**, or the
**cooldown** (6h) has elapsed since the last alert. Recovered checks drop from state.
Nothing is silently dropped — every poll appends to `logs/runs.log`.

## Delivery evidence

The pre-check stages `watchdog/delivery-pending.json` before alert delivery.
Only a valid `tg-send` provider receipt moves the proposed cooldown state into
`state.json`. A definite rejection remains retryable on the next 30-minute poll.
A timeout or other uncertain send remains visible and is not sent again
automatically. The last accepted provider receipt is retained in
`watchdog/delivery-last.json`. Provider acceptance is not human receipt.

## Boundary

The investigator agent runs with `--allowedTools Read` only. The wrapper sends
its result through `bin/tg-send`; the agent has no send tool.

## Architecture

- `triage.py` — failure checks: pure functions over collected text → `CheckStatus`.
  Unit-tested (`tests/test_watchdog_triage.py`).
- `metrics.py` — spike checks: pure rate/budget functions → `CheckStatus`. Unit-tested
  (`tests/test_watchdog_metrics.py`).
- `monitors.toml` — spike-monitor config (log counters, processes, Supabase tables + budgets).
- `run.py` — collects real signals, loads/saves `state.json` + `metrics-history.json`,
  triages, emits the report + `WATCHDOG_JSON:`/`WATCHDOG_METRICS:` lines. Plumbing tested
  in `tests/test_watchdog_run.py`.
- `run-watchdog.sh` — cron entry; parses the pre-check, escalates to the agent.
- `prompts/investigate.md` — the read-only investigator prompt.

## Activate after review

No runtime was changed by this repair. After the reviewed commit reaches the
main checkout, run `pytest -q tests/test_watchdog_delivery.py tests/test_watchdog_retry.py tests/test_watchdog_wrapper.py`
and `watchdog/run-watchdog.sh --dry-run`. The existing 30-minute cron entry then
uses the repaired wrapper automatically. The dry run does not send or commit
notification suppression.

The wrapper owns one file lock across precheck, investigation and delivery. It persists an `attempting` delivery before calling Telegram; interruption requires inspection, not automatic replay. An accepted receipt is saved before cooldown state, and a later interrupted local commit resumes from that receipt without sending again. `--dry-run` passes through to the precheck and does not stage pending delivery, cooldown or metric state. The wrapper may still append its diagnostic run log. State writes sync the file and directory.
