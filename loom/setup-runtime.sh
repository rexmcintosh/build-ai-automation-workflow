# Provision (or repair) the dedicated Loom cron runtime: a clone of this repo pinned to
# `main`, with its OWN venv. The nightly cron runs loom from HERE, never from the shared
# dev checkout — because interactive sessions flip the shared repo's working tree between
# branches, and a flip mid-run once deleted loom/prompts/route.md out from under a live
# backfill. This clone's working tree is never flipped, so loom's tracked code+prompts
# are stable for the duration of a run.
#
# Loom DATA (state/ledger/spool/learnings/logs) is NOT duplicated here: cli.py hardcodes
# the shared repo's loom/ dir, and those files are gitignored so branch flips never touch
# them. So this runtime supplies CODE only; the shared repo remains the data home.
#
# `import loom`/`import council` and loom's _PROMPTS are bound by the editable install +
# module location, so they MUST resolve to THIS clone — hence a separate venv with an
# editable install rooted here. Idempotent: safe to re-run to repair the clone or venv.
