# from under a live run. RUNTIME is never flipped. Loom DATA + logs stay in the shared
# repo (DATA_REPO): cli.py hardcodes that loom/ dir and those files are gitignored, so
# branch flips never disturb them. Install this script's path from RUNTIME in cron.

# Promote runs HERE, inside the absorb flock, rather than near the 23:50 diem
# deadline. A drain job hard-killed at that deadline dies mid-weave and leaves the
# loom-shadow worktree dirty, and promote's preflight (rightly) aborts on a dirty
# shadow — that happened on 2026-07-19. Under this flock no other loom process is
# running, so the shadow has settled. `--auto` consults the gate: it stands down on
# a hold, and refuses outright if a _staged/.claude swap is waiting (those rewrite
# live memories/skills and stay hand-gated). A refusal is a normal outcome.
