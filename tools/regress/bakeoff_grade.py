"""Grade a chair bake-off evidence file against the design's rubric.

`docs/chair-bakeoff-design-2026-09-11.md` §4. Every score is a string match or a
structural check on the recorded JSON, and every match prints the substring it
matched, so a reader can disagree with a score without re-running anything.

Two deliberate departures from the design, both forced by facts it did not check
(see docs/chair-bakeoff-results-2026-09-12.md §"What the design got wrong"):

1. Axis 1 is read off the chair's own `blocking_findings`, not the gate's
   `decide_blocking` count. On `stw-pr11` and `baw-pr11` every changed path is
   developer tooling, so `risk_tier` is "reduced", the tier bar is
   `critical` + c>=8, no panel finding in either is `critical`, and the gate
   returns 0 whatever the chair decides. Grading on the gate count would score
   those two cells identically for every candidate.
2. Case C's Axis 1 target is the chair's blocking list, not
   `review_status == "changes_requested"`. `REVIEW_SYNTH_OUTPUT` — the gate's
   chair prompt — never asks for `review_status`; only backlog-run's prompt
   does. On this path the field is structurally "unknown" for every model.
